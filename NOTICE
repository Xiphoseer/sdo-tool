AGPL-3.0 explicitly includes the ability to supplement the license
with additional terms of a particular nature. This isn't an exception
to the license (in the sense of a SPDX WITH) clause but rather provides
that wherever the source code references additional terms under this
section, AGPL requires any licensee to conform to them. This file
describes the requirements that apply to the SDO-Toolbox:

Pursuant to §7b of the AGPL-3.0 you must not remove partially or completely any parts
of this NOTICE file, Cargo.toml author or license fields, or any source code explicitly
referencing this NOTICE file.

Pursuant to §7c of the AGPL-3.0 you must not remove from the source code any
author attribution referencing this NOTICE file. If you create modified versions,
you must take reasonable effort to reference the original SDO-Toolbox via the
https://sdo.dseiler.eu URL and point out modifications.

Pursuant to §7d of the AGPL-3.0 you must not use for publicity purposes the name
of any author marked in Cargo.toml files, the credits in the README or people
involved in the original Signum product by ASH whose file format this project
implements for interoperability and digital preservation purposes.
