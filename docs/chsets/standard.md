# Standard Charsets

This page contains information on how separate Signum! fonts map to characters
in [Unicode]. To allow me and other to automate that process, the mappings
are provided as `Format A` mapping tables, that specify a unicode code-point
for each character that can be mapped with its name and the character itself.

[Unicode]: https://unicode.org

Some non-standard fonts that I came across are listed [here](other.html).
