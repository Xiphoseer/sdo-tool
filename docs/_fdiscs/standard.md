At some point, the standard 9-needle (P9) and 24-needle (P24) fonts
were part of "German Signum", while the Laser (L30) fonts were available
on a separate "German Laserdriver" disk.

This page contains information on how the standard Signum! fonts map to characters
in [Unicode]. To allow me and other to automate that process, the mappings
are provided as `Format A` mapping tables, that specify a unicode code-point
for each character that can be mapped with its name and the character itself.
