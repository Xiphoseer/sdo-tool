# Signum!

This crate is an implementation of the document file format (`*.SDO`)
and related formats, that were used by the word processor [Signum!]
first published in 1986 by [Application Systems Heidelberg][ASH] (Germany)
for the ATARI ST.

At the moment, it's mostly an implementation detail of the
[Signum!-Document-Toolbox][SDO-Tool] and only reading the
files is implemented.
